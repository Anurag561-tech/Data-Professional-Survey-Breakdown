# Data Professional Survey Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents a detailed analysis of a survey conducted among 630 data professionals, providing insights into various aspects of their careers. The dashboard is designed using **Power BI** and displays key metrics such as job satisfaction, salary breakdown by job title, work-life balance, and preferred programming languages.

The goal of the dashboard is to provide a comprehensive visual breakdown of the data, enabling users to explore the relationships between job roles, compensation, and career satisfaction.

## Key Metrics

1. **Country of Survey Takers**: 
    - The respondents come from different countries, with the largest group being from the United States, followed by India, the United Kingdom, and Canada. This is visualized using a treemap for a comparative view.

2. **Average Salary by Job Title**:
    - The dashboard breaks down average salaries by job roles such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Architect, and more. Data Scientists have the highest average salary, while other roles like Database Developers and Analysts show lower averages.

3. **Favourite Programming Language**:
    - The most popular programming language among respondents is Python, followed by R and others. This is visualized using a stacked bar chart that shows the favorite language preference across different job titles.

4. **Happiness with Work/Life Balance and Salary**:
    - Two gauge charts reflect the overall happiness of survey respondents. The average score for work-life balance is 5.74 out of 10, while salary satisfaction is lower, averaging 4.27 out of 10.

5. **Difficulty to Break into Data Roles**:
    - A donut chart displays the perceived difficulty of entering the data profession. The largest proportion of respondents feel that entering the data field is "neither easy nor difficult," followed by those who find it "easy."

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: Used for creating the interactive dashboard and visualizing survey results.
- **DAX Calculations**: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used to compute metrics such as the average salary by job role and overall satisfaction scores.
- **Survey Dataset**: The dataset consists of 630 data professionals, covering multiple job roles and regions across the globe.

## How to Use

1. **Explore by Country**:
    - Use the treemap to filter the results by country and explore how different metrics, such as salary and job satisfaction, vary by region.

2. **Job Role and Salary Analysis**:
    - Interact with the bar charts to view the average salary and job role preferences for different data professionals.

3. **Programming Language Preferences**:
    - The stacked bar chart allows you to explore the programming language preferences of various job roles, highlighting the popularity of Python, R, and others.

4. **Satisfaction Gauges**:
    - The gauge charts provide an overview of how satisfied data professionals are with their work-life balance and salary. These visuals update dynamically based on filters applied to other parts of the dashboard.

## Future Improvements

- **More Detailed Filters**: Additional filters can be introduced to allow users to explore data based on experience levels or industry sectors.
- **Longitudinal Insights**: Adding time-based data to track changes in salary, job satisfaction, and programming language trends over the years.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Adding more sophisticated visualizations, such as scatter plots, to examine the correlation between factors like experience and salary.

## Conclusion

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the data professional landscape, offering valuable insights into salary expectations, job satisfaction, and programming preferences. With the ability to interact and filter data based on various parameters, it serves as a useful tool for both aspiring and current data professionals to benchmark themselves against industry trends.
